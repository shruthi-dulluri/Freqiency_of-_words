I think not at this stage. We are looking to do this ourselves but want to see how much more it wold be to have others do it for us. Just out of interest how much cheaper is it if it were a one man job and we were to move the items ourselves to the ground floor beforehand?
Again probably specific time again

Give me quotes for both 1 man and 2 men
Thanks
I'm Sourit. Let me first confirm with my wife about the quote. Please send me an email and I will reply/give you a call about booking from there.
"Yes, sure. I'm happy with the quote too. Let me still confirm."
"Just a quick query, Rob."
And is this a 2 men quote?
Great
Ok
What will be the 1 man quote?
"Sure For one man, do I have to help them load and unload stuff?"
But what's the coronavirus regulation for this?
"If I help the man, how to maintain the distance?"
Ok
I received an email already. So thanks
Sorry I haven't got a link
"Hi Rob, I got the email now."
"It mentions the postcodes, not the exact locations. Do I not need to give the exact addresses?"
"Ok, I have got it now Just quickly, what does the service include? Loading, unloading, insurance etc?"
It mentions an inventory. Should it be the same? There may be some additions later. I forgot to mention a bookcase
"Ok. There will be a bookcase and a pc for sure. Sorry, should it mean the prices will impact heavily, even if there is a suitcase or an appliance added later?"
Ok. I'm sorry for this. May I ask you to cancel the booking for now? Let me have a complete inventory and get back to you over the email. Meanwhile please do let me know what the price difference will be.
Great
What will be the price with a book case and a pc added?
Flexible time is good. But let me confirm booking over an email later
